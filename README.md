# advent-2018

This is my code for the 2018 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018),
all solutions in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

I will only push code on (or after) December 26, after the challenge has
completed.

## Usage

This project is managed with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Running the
following will download any dependencies and start a REPL:

```
lein repl
```

If/when I set up a more "unified" runner-framework around the problems, I'll
document that here.
